# Cancer Subtyping

## Literature Review

### Example

[He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., & Sun, J. (2016). *Deep residual learning for image recognition.* In *Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR)* (pp. 770â€“778).](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2016.90)

  - **Summary:** ResNet (Residual Network) is a deep convolutional neural network architecture designed to overcome the degradation problem that occurs when neural networks become very deep. In traditional CNNs, as more layers are added, training accuracy often saturates and then degrades due to vanishing/exploding gradients. ResNet solved this by introducing residual learning, which allows layers to learn modifications (residuals) to the input rather than entire transformations.

## Cancer Subtyping 

Looking for recent (2025) papers with cancer subtyping, open source, deep learning, federated learning...

### 1. [A Review of Advanced Deep Learning Methods of Multi-Target Segmentation for Breast Cancer WSIs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10979932)

- **Summary:** TODO: Finish! But for now... It has a really good breakdown of different multi-modal breast cancer datasets. Might be good for federated learning, but need to make sure subtype labels exist first (if not, clustering?)

### 2. [Subtype-GAN: a deep learning approach for integrative cancer subtyping of multi-omics data](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/16/2231/6143031)
- **Summary**: TODO: Whenever I read it... I will tell you - Tera

### 3. [DeePathNet: A Transformer-Based Deep Learning Model Integrating Multiomic Data with Cancer Pathways](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39530738/)
- Tera is on fire...
